## Master thesis project 2021 
This repository contains the code used in the master thesis project: Sequential pruning in Hearthstone. The code is an extension to the Fireplace simulator found at: https://github.com/jleclanche/fireplace. The project revolves around experimenting with different data structures and pruning methods for a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) agent.
